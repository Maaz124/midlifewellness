[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]
Welcome to Week 1 of your Mind-Body Reset journey. I'm here to guide you through understanding the beautiful, complex symphony of hormones that influence every aspect of your midlife experience.

[MAIN CONTENT - 0:30-10:00]
Let's start with the truth: your hormones aren't broken, they're transitioning. Think of perimenopause as your body's wisdom preparing for the next chapter of your life.

The three key players we'll focus on:

ESTROGEN - Your mood stabilizer
- Fluctuating estrogen affects serotonin production
- This explains the emotional rollercoaster you might be experiencing
- Low estrogen can impact memory and focus - you're not losing your mind

PROGESTERONE - Your calm companion
- Known as nature's anti-anxiety hormone
- Declining progesterone can disrupt sleep and increase anxiety
- Understanding this helps you respond with compassion, not frustration

CORTISOL - Your stress responder
- Chronic stress during midlife amplifies hormonal symptoms
- When cortisol is elevated, it interferes with other hormone production
- Learning to manage stress becomes crucial for hormonal balance

[PRACTICAL SECTION - 10:00-11:30]
Your daily hormone-supporting practices:
1. Morning sunlight exposure - regulates cortisol rhythm
2. Protein at breakfast - stabilizes blood sugar and mood
3. Evening wind-down routine - supports progesterone production
4. Mindful movement - not intense exercise that spikes cortisol

[CLOSING - 11:30-12:00]
