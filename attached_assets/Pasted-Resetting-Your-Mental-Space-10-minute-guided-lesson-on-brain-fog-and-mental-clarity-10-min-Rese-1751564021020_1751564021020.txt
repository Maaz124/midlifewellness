[INTRO - 0:00-0:45]
Your mind during perimenopause might feel like a browser with too many tabs open. Today we're learning to close the unnecessary ones and focus on what truly matters.

[MAIN CONTENT - 0:45-8:00]
THE PERIMENOPAUSE BRAIN TRUTH:
Your brain is literally rewiring itself. The prefrontal cortex - your executive function center - is adapting to hormonal changes. This isn't decline, it's renovation.

COMMON EXPERIENCES:
- "Brain fog" - difficulty concentrating
- Word retrieval challenges
- Feeling mentally scattered
- Overwhelm with daily tasks

THE RESET APPROACH:
Instead of fighting these changes, we'll work WITH your brain's new patterns.

TECHNIQUE 1: The 3-Minute Mental Clear
- Set a timer for 3 minutes
- Write down every thought racing through your mind
- Don't judge, just dump it all onto paper
- Notice how your mind feels clearer after

TECHNIQUE 2: Single-Tasking Practice
- Choose ONE task for the next 25 minutes
- Put phone in another room
- Focus solely on that task
- Celebrate completion before moving to the next

TECHNIQUE 3: Energy-Based Scheduling
- Track your mental energy patterns for one week
- Schedule demanding tasks during your peak energy times
- Use low-energy times for routine or creative tasks

[PRACTICAL APPLICATION - 8:00-9:30]
This week's challenge:
- Practice the 3-Minute Mental Clear every morning
- Implement single-tasking for at least two work sessions daily
- Begin tracking your energy patterns

[CLOSING - 9:30-10:00]
Your changing brain is not a problem to solve - it's a masterpiece being refined. Trust the process and be patient with yourself.
Key Takeaways:
Perimenopause brain is renovating, not declining
Brain fog is temporary and manageable
Single-tasking improves focus and reduces overwhelm
Energy-based scheduling maximizes productivity
Mental clearing creates space for clarity
Brain Fog Clearing Practice
Mental clarity techniques designed for your changing brain patterns during midlife transitions.

Why This Exercise Works
During perimenopause, hormonal fluctuations affect neurotransmitters that impact focus and memory. This "brain dump" technique works by:

â€¢ Clearing Mental Clutter: Writing thoughts externally frees up cognitive space
â€¢ Reducing Cognitive Load: Stops your brain from trying to remember everything at once
â€¢ Activating the Prefrontal Cortex: The act of writing engages your brain's executive function
â€¢ Creating Mental Space: Gives your mind permission to let go of racing thoughts
3-Minute Mental Clear Exercise
Before starting: Rate your current mental clarity below, then complete the exercise and rate again to see the difference.


Step 1: Set a timer for 3 minutes
Use your phone or a kitchen timer. The time limit creates urgency that helps bypass your inner critic.


Step 2: Write down every racing thought - no judgment
Let everything flow onto paper: worries, to-dos, random thoughts. Don't edit or organize - just dump it all out.


Step 3: Notice how your mind feels after the brain dump
Take 30 seconds to observe: Is there more space? Less mental noise? Any sense of relief or clarity?
