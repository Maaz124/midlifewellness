## 🔍 **Component ID Mapping Needed**

- `w2-mirror-affirmations` (maps to `mirror-affirmations`)
- `w2-thought-audit` (maps to `thought-audit`)
- `w2-nlp-reframing` (maps to `nlp-reframing`)

### **Week 3 Expected IDs:**

- `w3-technique` (maps to `pause-label-shift`)
- `w3-boundaries` (maps to `boundaries-worksheet`)

## ⚠️ **Action Required**

The component routers in each week file need to check for the **actual component IDs from coaching-data.ts**, not the function names. 

**Example Fix Needed in week1.tsx:**
```typescript
// Current (wrong):
if (id === 'focus-memory-rituals') return <...>;

// Should be (if that ID exists in coaching-data.ts):
if (id === 'hormone-symphony') return <...>;
```

## ✅ **What's Working**

1. ✅ All files compile without errors
2. ✅ No linting errors
3. ✅ Proper exports (`export default function Week1...`)
4. ✅ Component loader correctly configured
5. ✅ Shared types and data files created
6. ✅ All components have proper props structure

---

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

1. [ ] Open coaching page
2. [ ] Click any Week 1 component → Should load from `week1.tsx`
3. [ ] Click any Week 2 component → Should load from `week2.tsx`
4. [ ] Verify component IDs match `coaching-data.ts`
5. [ ] Test data persistence (saving/loading)
6. [ ] Test completion flow

## 📝 **Original Code Location**

**Source:** `client/src/components/enhanced-coaching-component-fixed.tsx`
- **Size:** 15,863 lines
- **Status:** Still exists (can be deleted after successful testing)

**Components were extracted from lines:**
- Week 1: Lines 36-1236
- Week 2: Lines 1712-5654  
- Week 3: Lines 6592-9750
- Week 4: Lines 9751-12685

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Fix component ID mappings** in each week file to match `coaching-data.ts`
2. **Test each component** to ensure proper routing
3. **Verify data persistence** works correctly
4. **Delete original file** once confirmed working
